Hello ğŸ‘‹, I made a programming language called 'REPLisp'. It is a Lisp-like interpreted language, written in 100% pure JavaScript by my little fingers ğŸ––. I made it to just learn more about languages and how do they work.

I started work on this after I encountered [this project](https://glitch.com/~the-super-tiny-compiler) on Glitch. After going through everything over there, I felt **"making a programming language is so easy!!!"**, and eventually, made the first version almost *in a day*! I, gradually, learnt a lot about the basics of compilers and languages.

It is currently incomplete but is in active development. I'd love if you help me in completing this project.
